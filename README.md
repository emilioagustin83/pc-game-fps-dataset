# PC Game System Requirements & Estimated FPS by GPU

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.23162308.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.23162308)

System requirements for **17,400+ PC games** and **estimated 1080p frame rates on 12 reference GPUs**, from integrated graphics (Intel Iris Xe, Radeon 780M) to the RTX 4090, plus benchmark scores for **1,381 GPUs**.

The data comes from [PCGameBenchmarks](https://pcgamebenchmarks.com), a free FPS calculator for PC games. Every row links to its page on the site, which has the full breakdown at 1080p, 1440p and 4K for the Low, Medium, High and Ultra presets.

## How the FPS estimates are made

Each game gets a baseline from its Steam minimum (and recommended) GPU and its category (esports, indie, AAA, demanding AAA). The FPS on a GPU is that baseline scaled by the GPU's benchmark score along a fitted curve, with separate multipliers for resolution and quality preset. The model is calibrated against **2,070 measured benchmark results** from GameGPU and Notebookcheck (desktop GPUs, integrated graphics, and games from 2007 to 2026): a typical estimate lands within about 30% of the measured result (about 40% on integrated GPUs), with no bias towards any GPU tier.

They are **estimates, not measurements**: real FPS also depends on the CPU, RAM, drivers, game patches and the scene, and they do not include ray tracing, upscaling or frame generation. Treat them as "what to expect", not as benchmark results.

The full method, with every constant and its limits, is documented at **[pcgamebenchmarks.com/methodology](https://pcgamebenchmarks.com/methodology)**.
